I think it&amp;rsquo;s a very painful experience to even get sound in Arch. I figure if I write this down in a blog post so that others and myself can follow along make their own sound work.
Firstly make sure to upgrade Arch and packages.
sudo pacman -Syu Alright, now install pulseaudio which is like a software front-end which sits on top of alsa which is your kernel level sound mixer that directly talks to sound card.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a novice/beginner in using Linux, heck even a DIY distribution like <a href="https://archlinux.org/" title="Arch">https://archlinux.org/</a>. I think it&rsquo;s a very painful experience to even get sound in Arch. I figure if I write this down in a blog post so that others and myself can follow along make their own sound work.</p>
<p>Firstly make sure to upgrade Arch and packages.</p>
<pre><code>sudo pacman -Syu
</code></pre>
<p>Alright, now install <code>pulseaudio</code> which is like a software front-end which sits on top of <code>alsa</code> which is your kernel level sound mixer that directly talks to sound card.</p>
<p>At the same time install <code>alsa-utils</code> for some useful tools.</p>
<pre><code>pacman -S pulseaudio alsa-utils
</code></pre>
<p><code>alsa-utils</code> contain <code>alsa-mixer</code> which is good enough if you are a CLI freak. <code>alsa-mixer</code> is like a CLI volume control/mixer to control the volume coming out of your sound devices. Or if you don&rsquo;t like that, try to use <code>pavucontrol</code>.</p>
<pre><code>pacman -S alsamixer pavucontrol
</code></pre>
<p>If you are lucky you should have a literal deafening sound when you try to play any application with sound. Try to go on Youtube and play  video and see if you are deaf or not ðŸ’€.</p>
<p>Or if you are unlucky like me.. I got no sound because I plugged my earphone into an earphone jack that is in my monitor which is connected through HDMI. If you are using <code>alsa-mixer</code> press the hotkey to switch your sound cards to HDMI and see if the volume there is muted or not, in my case it was.</p>
<p>I am still experimenting with window managers (AwesomeWM) and trying to hotkey volume and get a widget that controls it. Once that&rsquo;s done I&rsquo;ll make another blog post on how to do it.</p>

The original theme is kind of minimalist which is good if I want to add features but at the same time I want other features from other themes too. I&amp;rsquo;ve been referencing other themes to modify this theme.
Hugo is a pain in the butt. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to learn Go but it&amp;rsquo;s going to be taking a while&amp;hellip;
In the mean time to test image uploading, here&amp;rsquo;s a cat.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Customizing this site is kinda hard.</p>
