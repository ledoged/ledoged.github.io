I think it&amp;rsquo;s a very painful experience to even get sound in Arch. I figure if I write this down in a blog post so that others and myself can follow along make their own sound work.
Firstly make sure to upgrade Arch and packages.
sudo pacman -Syu Alright, now install pulseaudio which is like a software front-end which sits on top of alsa which is your kernel level sound mixer that directly talks to sound card.</description></item></channel></rss>
